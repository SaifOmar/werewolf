This a one night werewolf and the villagers game, this game will be made with react vite and capacitor to be put on a phone so that me and my friends can play it, the main reason it's really made is the fact that you need a judge to play the game and we don't want one of us just sitting there, so the game I am making will be that judge, by taking in player names then ask to pass the phone to a player so that he can see his role, then the next and the next so on, make sure all rolse are hidden until a button asking if you should show the role is clikcked, then a nother button if the role had an action to do, then the player performs the action, then you save that action and move on, and so on and forth until all players finish the actinon, then ask to pass the phone again, to players to see the result of their actions(do it for all even if they don't have a real action just so no one can know you have no action)  then start the timer and discussion then start fvote then end the game,
